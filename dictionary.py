# each key must be unique - it's not possible to have more than one key of the same value;
# a key may be any immutable type of object: it can be a number (integer or float), or even a string, but not a list;
# a dictionary is not a list - a list contains a set of numbered values, while a dictionary holds pairs of values;
# the len() function works for dictionaries, too - it returns the numbers of key-value elements in the dictionary;
# a dictionary is a one-way tool - if you have an English-French dictionary, you can look for French equivalents of English terms, but not vice versa.
